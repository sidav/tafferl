  "BriefingText": "Things got worse lately. After all my struggle, after all the second chances I'm standing right where I belong. The factory I worked in has been shut down. No more job, no more clean hands. Guess my old job still trying to get me. \n I have almost no money left. It will be not so much longer before I will start starving - and then what? Return to being a hired knife? I hate even thinkng of this. I'll better end up picking pockets on a market square. Better being a thief than a murderer. \n And that thought have led me to an idea. A friend of mine mentioned something about his lord selling his mansion. With all the moving, security will be less strict than usual. The goodies will be moved in three days. I don't think the lord needs his goodies too badly, huh? \n Thus said, I have three days for the job. I don't need much - a thousand worth of gold will be enough for some time. I can move out just tonight, or tomorrow, or even later, but the earlier I move out, the more luxuries will be there. And more luxuries means more guards.",
